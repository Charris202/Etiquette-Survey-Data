# Etiquette-Survey-Data
I picked the question "Is it rude to recline your seat on a plane?" because I am genuinely interested in people's opinions about the matter. This is a recurring question amongst people when it comes to plane etiquette. My chart shows that a majority of respondents do not feel like reclining in a plane seat is rude at all. This can exemplify how diverse opinons are when it comes to plane etiquette.
